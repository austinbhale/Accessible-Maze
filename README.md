# findSitterson(UNC-CS-professors);
## Inspiration
With a new virtual school, the Enabling Technology Club has been unable to prepare for UNC's annual Maze Day event. This event invites students with visual impairments to play fun games, so we wanted to create one online! Our game utilizes spatial audio to guide the visually impaired through the maze. It can also be used for students with other disabilities thanks to the option of using touch-screen arrows/buttons and keypresses.
## What it does
This blind-accessible maze game takes advantage of spatial audio to guide the user. It uses a depth-first search recursive implementation to generate new mazes. As the player moves closer to Sitterson (the final destination), the volume increases. If the player runs into a wall, they will know exactly which direction the wall sound comes from using spatial audio. There are twelve levels in the game to win, with four different complexities. However, you can keep playing with a completely new maze by clicking "New Maze"!
## How I built it
Built entirely with p5js.
## Challenges I ran into
Working with spatial audio and figuring out how to use sound to best guide a player with visual disabilities.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning new APIs, learning best practices for accessibility games, a finished product with full spatial sound and regenerative maze capabilities, and working together with an awesome team!
## What I learned
p5js, Web Audio API (PannerNodes)
## What's next for findSitterson(UNC-CS-professors);
Showing it off at the next UNC CS Maze Day!!
